Unreal Engine 4.27
python 3.9.12
model still under development !
NOTES TO SELF :D
-Model needs to be updated in order to be robust (random spawns of the drone , trying to hover over different targets not just 1)
-check  if the kinematics position matches the unreal ungine's (for real world applications this needs to be changed to gps position )
-make sure the images are what they supposed to be and from the correct camera
-change/modify action space and/or inputs of network
